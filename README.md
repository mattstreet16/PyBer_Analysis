# PyBer_Analysis

### Using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Panadas, and Matplotlib to analyze ride-sharing data by city.

#### Overview
   
  Pyber, a python based ride-sharing app tasked me with analyzing the provided CSV files to help the company better understand the data and its realtion with the app's users. In order to do so, I will need to create visualizations the data in the provided CSVs. These charts and graphs will be created using Python's Matplotlib in a Pandas Jupyter Notbook, and will help the company understand the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers, as well as percentage of total fares, rider, and drivers by type of city, and lastly create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The visualizations and analysis of this data will help PyBer better imporve access and determine affordability for underserved app users.
