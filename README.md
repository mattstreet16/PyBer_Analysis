# PyBer_Analysis

### Using Python, Jupyter Notebook, Panadas, and Matplotlib to analyze ride-sharing data by city.

#### Overview
   
  Pyber, a python based ride-sharing app tasked me with analyzing the provided CSV files (Resources Folder) to help the company better understand the data and its realtion with the app's users. In order to do so, I will need to create visualizations of the data using the provided CSVs. These charts and graphs will be created using Python's Matplotlib in a Pandas Jupyter Notbook, and will help the company understand the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers, as well as percentage of total fares, rider, and drivers by type of city, and lastly create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The visualizations and analysis of this data will help PyBer better imporve access and determine affordability for underserved app users.
   
#### Results

The dataframe shows that urban cities are by far the bussiest city type, however it has more drivers than riders, and has the lowest owest average fair per ride and per driver. The dataframe also displays the a large drop in both riders and driver in suburban and rural areas.

The line chart help display what was stated previously, Urban cities bring in much more money compared to the other types. 


#### Summary
Based of the analysis of the provided data, if Pyber wants to expand into underserved areas there are multiple ways of adressing the disparities among the city types.

1. Advertising in suburban and rural areas more.
2. Offering special dicounts for riders in rural and suburban areas
3. Offering drivers in rural and suburban areas a special raise 
4. In rural and suburabn areas Pyber could offer a food and grocery delivery service as well as ride-sharing

If Pyber can expand its reach into suburban and urban areas the company will see less of a disparity amoung city type users, and offering an expanded service in these areas may also improve business a reach a brader target of need for diffferent users.
